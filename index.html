      My journy to become a software developer</h3>
      <h4>
      Young Márk as a Game Developer</h4>
      <p>
      I was 12 years old when is started to use Game Maker which is a Delphi based cross-platform game engine. I started to develope Computer Games just for myself. Mostly 2D Mario like games, and a few RTS. I draw the caracters and animated them with very basic tehniques.</p>
      <h4>
      Software development as a Mechanical Engineer</h4>
      <p>
      Its not an ordinary thing that a Mechanical Engineer create softwares for his company, then how did it happen? 2 and a half years ago I started to work as a Process Engineer. As my first project I had to design a production line for the new multimedia unit. It was challanging but everything worked fine, till one day the project leader called me into his office. He told me we have some problems, becouse we are out of budget and we need 3 more automatic equipment. I told him its not a big deal, we will build them by ourself. </br>
        <strong>It was waaaay harder than I thought back than.</strong>
      I have designed the parts, and the workshop manufactured them for us. Then I redesigned them a few more times, till finally we had a quite good machine. I was proud and showed them for the project leader. He agreed with me that they look nice, but he said:</br>
      <strong>It's okay Márk, now let's see an automatic cycle.</strong>
      After a few seconds of silence I started to explain to him that I can't program a PLC. He assured me that he trust me completely, then said goodbey. I felt motivated so I went in at Saturday, opened a YouTube in my web browser and started to type: Twincat PLC programming for beginners. After a few more weeks, the automatic cycle worked. I liked it so much that I even implemented the TCP/IP communication with the MES(Manufacturing Executive System). They saw how I like it, so they sent me to a PLC programming training. After that I practiced it in all of my freetime in work. I was quity successful, so they asked me to correct the bugs in every other machine on the line. One year later there was no machine supplier I don't debugged at least one machine for.
      </p>
      <h4>Let's improve our daily work with C# softwares</h4>
      <p>
        Last year there was a quiet period in work, and one of my colleague was annoyed becouse of the passwords of the production machines. The mechanicers couldn't work on the machines, becouse every machine supplier set different passwords on the machines, and they always forget it. We need a program where we can show the passwords for the colleagues depending on the access level.</br>
        <strong>This is the challange I was waited for!</strong> I downloaded the Visual Studio, opened a browser and typed: C# programming for beginners! Two weeks later we installed my software on the production PCs, and they started to use. I liked it even more than PLC programming. I realised my possibilities are endless, and I can show my creativity. So I started to looking for the needs of my company. I made softwares which:
      </p>
      <ul class="fu">
        <li>can communicate with the PLCs via ADS(TCP/IP) to speed up the troubleshooting process.</li>
        <li>can communicate with the controller of the screwdrivers to be able to make bursting tests automatically.</li>
        <li>can analize datas of screwdriving process and makes reports.</li>
        <li>can analize datas of strain measurement process and makes reports.</li>
        <li>can detect pseudo AOI fail products(with ML) and correct the decision in the MES.
        </li>
        <li>
          and so on...
        </li>
      </ul>
